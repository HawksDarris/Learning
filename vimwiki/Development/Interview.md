1. Outline understanding of the problem
2. Think of edge cases and inputs and outputs
3. pseudocode the solution
4. Ask how the result should be (i.e., do you need the inputs to be consecutive?)
5. Test with inputs and edge cases
6. Analyze time and space complexity with [Big O Notation](Big O Notation)

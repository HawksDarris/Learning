# I accidentally deleted my entire programming vimwiki
I did not think that `git rm -rf` would execute `rm -rf` on my local computer. It's my fault. In my defense, I though `git add` adds it to the repo and `git rm` removes it from the repo. I did not think `git rm` would also delete it from the local machine. I wonder how many hours of work this has cost other people so I can feel better about myself.

# Silver lining
I do not have to figure out how to switch vimwiki to org mode because I was thinking of doing that anyway.

It was mostly the stuff I had done on CodeWars and things I had learned.


# Update
I was able to save some of the headers.

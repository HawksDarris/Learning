# Creating lists
## Each element or value in a list is called an item.
## Lists are defined by having values between []

employees=["John","Paul","George","Ringo"]

#counting from 0 from the left, John is 0 and Ringo is 3
#You can also count from the right, where Ringo is -1

print(employees[3])
print(employees[-1])
print(employees[-3])
